          Aloha! My name is Sandy Kaauwai, i'm 56 years old and live in Wailua
          Houselots in the home I grew up in. I have three brothers, including a
          twin, and one sister who is my rock. My twin brother was born 4
          minutes before me. So he is technically older which is great now but
          not so great growing up. LOL. Ohana means everything to me. They are
          my family and my best friends and I couldnt have made it this far
          without each and every one of them! I had a cat but it recently got
          hit by a car... bummers!

        <p class="card-content">
          I work for the County of Kauai as the Film Commissioner. We haven't
          had many big movies lately but I'm working on it. Its an interesting
          job and I get to meet a lot of interesting people. Kauai has its
          limits so its been difficult to get this sector moving, especially
          with COVID happening about a year after I started. But all in all I
          enjoy working for the Office of Economic Development. I also manage
          Grants and other things and am currently getting most of our forms
          online. My eyeballs are ready to fall out at the end of the day!

        <p class="card-content">
          Meet my son, Kaikea! He is almost a quarter of a century old! He works
          for Entertainment Partners in their payroll department and lives in a
          really nice apartment in Newport Beach. He graduated from UCSB in
          2019, just before the pandemic hit, thank goodness! He is fun and
          funny and seems to be a lot like me. His Dad and stepmom live in
          California as well so he has ohana there! He also has a long time
          girlfriend named Mackenzie who is really great for him! I miss him
          dearly and will get to see him soon thanks to a work trip I have
          coming up!

        <p class="card-content">
          In my sparetime I try to take in as many sunsets as possible in as
          many different places as possible. I must have 1000 sunset photos so
          it was tough to decide which one to use. This photo was taken at Ke'e
          Beach about 2 years ago. I spent many summers camping in Haena and
          spending long days at Ke'e Beach before it became so crowded. My
          brothers and sisters played in the sand and swam all day. On the way
          back to the campsite, which we frequently walked to as there were no
          cars on the road, we'd stop at the Queens Bath to rinse off and jump
          off what seemed to be a very large rock. As I look at it now, its not
          very big. LOL. Some of the best years of growing up were spent on the
          North Shore at Haena Park and Ke'e Beach. It was a wonderous time,
          where we would sit and wait for a car to pass by. So many happy
          memories and there are even a few old phots that we've scanned but
          unfortunately I couldn't find them in time for this presentation!
